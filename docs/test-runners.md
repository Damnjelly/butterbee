Gleeunit is, as it stands, not a good test runner for browser tests. 
It has an unconfigurable timeout that is too short for anything except the shortest tests.

For browser tests i currently recommend using [qcheck_gleeunit_utils](https://github.com/varnerac/qcheck_gleeunit_utils) to run your tests.
